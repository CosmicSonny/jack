zez is suposed to be the "chosen one" in the storys game but its unsure if he even is the true hero in the story. Zez uses his tool hands which do normal damage to fight light and rock enemies, do double damage on wood enemies, but arent effective on iron eneimes. his special interaction abilitys is his builder skill(allows the player to build constructs with resorces near a specifc area) and digger skill(allows the player to move through dirt and digup tresure).
